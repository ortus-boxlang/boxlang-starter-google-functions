## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `src/main/bx/handlers/` convention for routed handlers, with a flat (`Products.bx`) and a nested (`api/Test.bx`) example.
- `generateManifest` Gradle task, which scans `handlers/` and generates `manifest.json` so the runtime never scans the filesystem for routable handlers at cold start. Wired into `test`, `runFunction`, and `buildLambdaZip` so it can never silently drift out of date.

### Changed

- Bumped `boxlangVersion` to 1.18.0, which includes a security fix restricting URI-routing and `x-bx-function` header dispatch to registered handlers only (previously, any root-level `.bx` file and any of its public methods, including `Application.bx`'s lifecycle callbacks, could be reached this way).
- Rewrote the "How Routing Works" section to document the `handlers/` convention (the previous docs described routing to any root-level `.bx` file, which is no longer supported).
